00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,710
You know, I've been coaching men for over a decade,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,750
from special forces to the best rock bands in the world,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,150
and I've learned that confidence isn't earned through thoughts,

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,550
but through actions

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,110
. Today I'm going to talk to you about how to develop it.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,990
And you're not going to get there with explanations, right?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,910
You have to dive in and take charge.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,990
One of the problems today is that women

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,270
don't care what you say.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,390
What matters to them is how you make them feel.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,310
And one of the most attractive qualities in women,

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,950
in this energy exchange, is confidence.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,390
If you're confident, if you're experienced,

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,510
if you know how it works, how this interaction works—

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,150
and let's be honest, a lot of men have that, right?

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,910
We just didn't have the visual, right?

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,830
When I practice with the bat, I can't seem to hit it right.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,230
So you have to take risks, right?

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,150
In this energy exchange,

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,750
you have to project that presence, something women crave more than anything.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,870
It's about safety and security; they need to hear what you're saying.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,110
And all of that comes from strong self-confidence.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,150
That's what I'm offering you today.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,910
Your challenge for today: Play the compliment game with men who...

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,390
Working men have a hard time approaching women.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,550
They have a hard time talking to them.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,750
My goal today is simply to get you into the habit of starting a conversation.

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,190
I want you to get into the habit of just making small talk.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,150
Walk up to someone and say, "It's me, I just wanted to say hi."

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,310
That's how the compliment challenge works.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,550
I want you to find the next five people.

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,150
When you interact with someone and give them a compliment,

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,910
I warn you: I don't want...

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,830
anything about their appearance.

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,270
I want you to think outside the box, but here's the thing:

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,110
think about a decision they had to make

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,110
or something they had to do. Think about it.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,510
It could be something they're wearing, it could be,

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,470
you know, maybe I have a purple streak in my hair, uh, maybe.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,470
Maybe I'm wearing custom Chuck Taylor shirts.

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,910
Maybe they have a Van Halen shirt, maybe they just have crazy charisma.

42
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,270
Which brings me back to the main point:

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,230
if you don't know what to say to a girl, simply say, "Wow, you have incredible charisma!"

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,190
Guys, look at the effect it has on women.

45
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,030
I assure you, it hits the nail on the head.

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,630
It's like

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,470
simply being with someone and giving them a compliment.

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,150
And I want to make one thing clear: it's not a compliment that expects something in return.

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,190
I don't want you to think I have to give this compliment and offer something in return.

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,790
No, the point of this challenge is simply to be a good person.

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,670
Change the lives of five people and observe the energy exchange that occurs.

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,190
Observe what happens when you remove any expectation of outcome from the conversation.

53
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,150
Approach someone, give them a compliment, and observe their reaction.

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,470
Also notice how easy it is when you don't try to calculate the value of the compliment.

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,390
You're just trying to have a good day without expecting anything in return.

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,910
You're simply trying to be...

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,390
a good person, a good guy, if that's your goal.

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,910
Interactions become much easier because of this, and that's exactly what I want from you.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,510
I want you to find five people today to do this with.

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,510
Then, I want you to make it a daily habit; it's something that becomes ingrained.

61
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,830
My girlfriend doesn't seem to notice, huh? She does it a lot.

62
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,350
But for me, it's become a deeply ingrained daily habit, and it's an integral part of my personality.

63
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,750
I give compliments everywhere I go: "Hey, man, look at your shoes!" "

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,910
How can I, being your brother, go to the gym like you?"

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,190
"Wow, this coffee is amazing, right?"

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,070
It's that simple.

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,590
Here's your challenge for today:

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,870
play as many compliment games as you can.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,990
In the next videos, I'll show you how.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,790
But I really want to get good at it.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,470
The first thing I see in the comments

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,870
is: "People do this challenge because they're not that intimidating, right?"

73
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,910
Well, no, they're just like you, I assure you.

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,070
The people you're talking to are probably just as shy and intimidating as you.

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,070
Compliment them.

76
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,230
Be kind, and you'll see how it will change their lives.

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,150
Their confidence and the way they approach others.

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,150
Trust is built through actions, not just thoughts.

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,150
That's all for today, that's all for this video.

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,310
We'll see you again tomorrow to discuss

81
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,630
growth mindset and how to reframe

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,390
things. This will build on what we've covered today.

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,390
So, take action today! Also, feel free to post in the community.

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,750
Share your thoughts on participating in this challenge.

85
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,870
Tell us what happened when you started paying attention

86
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,710
to others and what happened during those interactions.

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,390
That's all for today. I'm Robbie, and I'll see you tomorrow.
