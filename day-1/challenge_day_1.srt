1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,710
and look, i've been coaching men for well over decade from

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,750
special forces to some of the greatest rock bands in the world,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,150
and what i've learned is confidence is not something you're going to think your way to,

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,550
it's something you have to build with action.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,110
so today i'm going to talk to you about ways to actually build your confidence,

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,990
and it's not going to happen through affirmations, right?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,910
we're going to have to get out into the real world and make things happen.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,990
so one of the things in the context of what we're dealing with right now, is women,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,270
women don't really care as much what you say,

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,390
all they care about is how you make them feel,

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,310
and one of the biggest attraction markers for women

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,950
when it comes to an energy exchange is is he confident,

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,390
is he sure of himself, has he been here before,

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,510
does he know how this game, this interaction works,

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,150
and let's be honest, lot of guys know right,

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,910
we just haven't had the reps, we haven't been...

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,830
to batting cage and not to really get that good swing down,

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,230
so you have to go get your at bats, right?

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,150
with that energy exchange,

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,750
you have to give her this presence of one of the things women need the most,

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,870
which is safety and security, she has to feel what you're saying to her,

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,110
and all this comes from a grounded place of confidence,

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,150
so here's what I'm going to give you today guys,

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,910
your challenge today is to go play the compliment game, lot of guys that...

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,390
work with do have a hard time approaching women,

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,550
they have a hard time having conversations with women,

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,750
so what i want to do today is i just want to get you used to having conversations,

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,190
i want to get you used to just having conversations,

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,150
going up and talking to somebody and saying, this is who i am, just want to come say hey,

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,310
so here's how the compliment challenge works,

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,550
i want you to just find the next five people

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,150
you interact with and just pay them a compliment,

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,910
here's the caviot to this, i don't want to...

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,830
something about their physical attractiveness

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,270
I want you to think outside the box here
because here's the magic.

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,110
think about either decision the had to make

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,110
or something that they had to actually think about,

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,510
could be something they're wearing, could be,

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,470
you know, maybe she's got a purple stripe in her hair, um, maybe she's got like,

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,470
maybe she's got some decorated chuck tees on,

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,910
maybe she's got like a Van Halen t-shirt on, maybe she just got some great energy,

42
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,270
which by the way leads me into my number one hack here,

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,230
if you ever don't know what to say to a girl, just say, wow, you have amazing energy,

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,190
watch what happens guys, if something in the way the women receive that compliment,

45
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,030
i promise you, it lands and it works,

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,630
but you're having like you're just going

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,470
up with somebody and just giving them a compliment,

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,150
and here's what i also want to remember, this is a non-outcome based compliment,

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,190
i don't want you thinking i have to give this compliment and get something in return,

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,790
no, the point of this challenge is to just go be a good human,

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,670
go change five people's day and watch the energy exchange that happens,

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,190
watch what happens when you take an outcome off the conversation,

53
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,150
just go pay a compliment and watch how that other person reacts.

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,470
also, watch how much easier it gets for you, when you're not trying to land the number,

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,390
trying to land the day and you're not trying to get something out of that person,

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,910
all you're doing is trying to be...

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,390
good human and just go be a good guy, when that's your soul goal,

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,910
that interaction becomes lot easier, and here's what i want you to do,

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,510
i want you to go find five people today to go do that to,

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,510
then i want you to make that a daily habit, that's just something deeply ingrained,

61
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,830
it kind of weirds my girlfriend out uh because I do it so much,

62
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,350
but it's become the daily ingrained habit in who i am right now,

63
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,750
i just pay compliments everywhere i go, hey bro, I like look your shoes man,

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,910
like bro, how can i how can get in the gym like you?

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,190
or wow, this coffee is absolutely amazing, do you make this?

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,070
something as simple as that is what it's all about.

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,590
so that's your challenge today guys,

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,870
go have as many of those compliment challenge games as possible.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,990
i want to tell you in the coming videos about what to do after that,

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,790
but i want to get really good at this.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,470
the number one thing that hear in feedback from guys

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,870
doing this challenge is people aren't so scary are they?

73
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,910
like no, they're humans just like you, i promise you.

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,070
"the people you're talking to are probably just as insecure and scary as you are,

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,070
go just pay compliments,

76
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,230
be a good human and watch how that changes your

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,150
confidence level and approaching people moving forward,

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,150
because guys, we're building confidence through action, not through just thinking about it.

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,150
so guys, that's what i have for you today, that's today's video,

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,310
i'm going to see you tomorrow where we're going to talk about

81
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,630
a little bit more of the growth mindset and how to reframe

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,390
things and that's just going to build upon what we're doing today,

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,390
so make sure you take action today guys, also post in the community,

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,750
give us feedback how this challenge went,

85
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,870
let us know what happened when you started paying

86
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,710
compliments to people and what happened in those interactions.

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,390
all right guys, that's it, i'm Robbie and i'll see you tomorrow.
