1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
And look, I've been coaching men for
well over a decade, from special forces

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,000
some of the greatest rock bands in the
world.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,200
And what I've learned is confidence is
not something you're going to think your

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,840
way to. It is something you have to
build with action.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,580
So today I'm going to talk to you about
ways to actually build your confidence.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,400
And it's not going to happen through
affirmations, right? We're going to have

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,100
get out into the real world and make
things happen.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,040
one of the things in the context what
we're dealing with right now is women

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,720
women don't really care as much what you
say all they care about is how you make

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,900
them feel and one of the biggest
attraction markers for women when it

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,800
an energy exchange is is he confident is
he sure of himself has he been here

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,250
before does he know how this game this
interaction works And let's be honest, a

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,350
lot of guys know, right? We just haven't
had the reps. We haven't been to

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,950
batting cage and not to really get that
good swing down.

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,490
So you have to go get your at bats,
right?

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,770
With that energy exchange, you have to
give her this presence of one of the

17
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,630
things women need the most, which is
safety and security.

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:19,310
She has to feel what you're saying to
her. And all this comes from a grounded

19
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,430
place of.

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,510
confidence. So here's what I'm going to
give you today, guys.

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,250
Your challenge today is to go play the
compliment game.

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,510
A lot of guys that I work with do have a
hard time approaching women. They have

23
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,970
a hard time having conversations with
women. So what I want to do today is I

24
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,910
just want to get you used to having
conversations.

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,890
I want to get you used to just having
conversations, going up and talking to

26
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,490
somebody and saying, this is who I am.
Just want to come say, hey.

27
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,270
So here's how the compliment challenge
works.

28
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,450
I want you to just find the next five
people you interact with and just pay

29
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,450
a compliment.

30
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,470
Here's the caveat to this.

31
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,850
I don't want you to compliment something
about their physical attractiveness.

32
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,450
I want you to think outside the box here
because here's the magic.

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,550
Think about either a decision they had
to make or something that they had to

34
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,890
actually think about. It could be
something they're wearing. It could

35
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,130
You know, maybe she's got a purple
stripe in her hair.

36
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,650
Maybe she's got like, maybe she's got
some decorated Chuck keys on.

37
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,630
Maybe she's got like a Van Halen t
-shirt on.

38
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,890
Maybe she just got some great energy,
which by the way, leads me into my

39
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,370
one hack here.

40
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,650
If you ever don't know what to say to a
girl, just say, wow, you have amazing

41
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,710
energy. Watch what happens.

42
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,410
Guys, it's something in the way that
women receive that compliment. I promise

43
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,110
you, it lands and it works.

44
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,130
But you're having, like, you're just
going up to somebody and just giving

45
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,570
compliment. And here's what I also want
to remember. This is a non -outcome

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,650
-based compliment.

47
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,770
I don't want you thinking I have to give
this compliment and get something in

48
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,350
return. No, the point of this challenge
is to just go be a good human. Go change

49
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,670
five people's day.

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,680
And watch the energy exchange that
happens. Watch what happens when you

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,180
outcome off of the conversation.

52
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,040
Just go pay a compliment and watch how
that other person reacts.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,920
Also, watch how much easier it gets for
you.

54
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,760
When you're not trying to land the
number, trying to land the date, and

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,860
not trying to get something out of that
person, all you're doing is trying to be

56
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,220
a good human and just go be a good guy.

57
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,640
When that's your sole goal, that
interaction becomes a lot easier.

58
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,110
And here's what I want you to do.

59
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,850
I want you to go find five people today
to go do that too.

60
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,390
Then I want you to make that a daily
habit.

61
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,810
That's just something deeply ingrained.
It kind of weirds my girlfriend out

62
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,410
because I do it so much.

63
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,250
But it's become a daily ingrained habit
in who I am right now.

64
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,130
I just pay compliments everywhere I go.
Hey, bro, look at your shoes, man.

65
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,890
Like, bro, how can I get in the gym like
you?

66
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,910
Or, wow, this coffee is absolutely
amazing. Did you make this?

67
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,770
Something as simple as that.

68
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,620
is what it's all about so that's your
challenge today guys go have as many of

69
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,660
those compliment challenge games as
possible i want to talk to you in the

70
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,300
upcoming videos about what to do after
that but i want you to get really good

71
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,040
this the number one thing that i hear in
feedback from guys doing this challenge

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,580
is people aren't so scary are they like
no they're human just like you i promise

73
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,960
you the people you're talking to are
probably just as insecure and scary as

74
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,960
are Go just pay compliments, be a good
human and watch how that changes your

75
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,700
confidence level and approaching people
moving forward. Because guys, we're

76
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,360
building confidence through action, not
through just thinking about it. So guys,

77
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,620
that's what I have for you today. That's
today's video.

78
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm going to see you tomorrow where
we're going to talk about a little bit

79
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,680
of the growth mindset and how to reframe
things.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,020
And that's just going to build upon what
we're doing today. So make sure you

81
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,180
take action today, guys.

82
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,780
Also, host in the community.

83
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,260
Give us feedback how this challenge
went. Let us know what happened when you

84
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,040
started paying confidence to people and
what happened in those interactions.

85
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,860
All right, guys, that's it. I'm Robbie,
and I'll see you tomorrow.
