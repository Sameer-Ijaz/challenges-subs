00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,600
All right, guys, and welcome to day five
of the Attraction Blueprint, where

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,990
going to talk about advanced communication so yesterday we went over two protocols

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,110
to follow the fev protocol and the teas touch tell protocol um I hope you're practicing

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,150
those guys I would encourage you practice those every single interaction because like

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,710
anything the more you do it the better you're going to get at it but today what I want

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,710
to do is go over some advanced communication techniques so as you're using those two

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,910
protocols these

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,430
are some secondary things that you can implement that are

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,470
really going to take your communication to the next level.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,670
the very first one guys is you have to become a really good

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,550
storyteller and there's a couple aspects of telling stories with

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,750
women and dating that are really going to take your communication next level.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,750
the very first thing is learn how to tell a story that engages emotion right?

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,110
we have to tell stories that bring her in emotionally,

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,790
make her laugh or make her curious

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,350
as honestly one of the best emotions ever create in women,

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,430
and I'm going to go over an advanced technique how to do that in a minute,

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,230
but what I encourage you do here, and this is going to be great homework for you,

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,550
is sit down and think about your five most attractive stories.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,390
This is going to be, your most attractive story from work,

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,870
whether it could be accomplishment or probably the most

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,710
attractive story from work is something really hard you had to overcome,

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,910
and the lesson you learn about it, um, a really cool food story, a...

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,830
travel story, maybe a good concert story or a fun story, and then lastly a funny story.

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,110
um, those aren't like the five you have to have,

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,590
but the're just kind of the five that i found work best.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,230
um, so go home and write those out,

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,710
use ai if you need to, to say, hey, how do tell this story better,

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,150
you can actually input it in there and ask it to tell a better story.

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,230
um, but then practice telling those stories,

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,710
the better you can get at practicing those stories where maybe throw in a pause,

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,270
or maybe you work on your tone of coming down here for serious part of the story,

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,950
but then getting excited and talking up here,

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,070
practice delivering those stories that way when you're on the date,

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,750
your delivery is on point and you're just really

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,590
telling an amazing story that captivates her emotionally.

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,430
so the second thing that i want to talk you about today is the 70/30 rule,

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,190
guys there's actual published research that proves,

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,830
the more woman talks about herself, the more attractive she finds you,

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,630
so she's going to be attracted to you the more she talks about herself,

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,870
so therefore it is your job to get her talking about herself,

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,310
that's why the 730 rule, in a conversation with woman,

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,190
she should be talking 70% of time, you should be talking 30% of time,

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,790
and look, i know, i know, i know, i know, it's really hard,

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,550
um, it's conversation is not these thing to because we're we're really good at texting,

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,870
but in today's world in in-person communication entirely different,

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,470
but guys, it's fb protocol, you know the questions to ask her,

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,590
you just got to follow the protocol and ask her those questions,

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,510
so get her talking 70% of the time.

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,430
third thing that in advanced communication techniques is guys,

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,070
you've got to get really good at not only her body language,

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,910
but yours as well, let's talk about yours first and...

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,030
communication um 10 talks research actually proves the more you

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,830
talk with your hands the more engaged to the person is so talk with your hands

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,870
if you're telling story.

56
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,430
next thing in masculine body language

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,070
is anytime you move make it intentional deliberate movement.

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,630
if you're going to grab a drink, grab the drink, drink from it, put it down.

59
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,910
don't fidget. fidgeting is one of the worst things.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,950
you can do a date if you're constantly do heen guys do this a date constantly like

61
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,310
pulling out their shirt or constantly like rubbing their nose or rubbing their beard

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,750
um scratching their arm or you know just filling with their hands guys the more you

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,590
fidget and the more you move without intention the more anxious and

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,590
anxiety anxious you're going to be anxiety you're

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,910
going to give her calm guys that are extremely confident.

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,590
"We're good, we don't need to be doing all that,

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,630
I can sit, chill as can be, I don't have to move,

68
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,030
I'm good, that's the body language you have to portray,

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,670
because when you feel safe on that date, what energy are you giving her?

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,230
Safety, so you have to present a calm,

71
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,350
deliberate, very, very stable body language, because that's going to make her feel safe.

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,830
With her, what I would suggest is pick up..." on her body language,

73
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,510
is she constantly looking down or looking away,

74
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,670
is she playing with her hair a lot, is she fidgety?

75
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,950
uh, guys, one of the funnest things i should

76
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,430
do on dates is like if i saw a girl like fidgety or...

77
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,930
is playing with her hair i like no it's so cute you being nervous like this

78
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,330
i would call it out and she would instantly look of course you would alone

79
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,330
embarrass but she would instantly relax like hey look we're just two strangers

80
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,090
trying to get the know each other like this isn't like this not a pressure here

81
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,570
like let's just have fun um but pay attention to her body language especially

82
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,690
when it comes to if you're trying escalate physically you know if you touch her

83
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,930
and she pulls back well hey slow your roll be respectful if you tou sure she

84
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,770
leans in is she reciprocates,

85
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,970
hey, now we know we're in a good place, um, is she leaning into you,

86
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,650
is she sitting back, her arms cross,

87
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,610
does she have an open body posture, is she showing you her neck,

88
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,610
all those are really good signs,

89
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,170
um, is she closed off, is she angling away from you, which is not a good sign,

90
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,370
um, but pay attention to her body language,

91
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,370
especially when you're telling story or you're talking to her, pay attention to her face,

92
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,900
pay attention to her, eyes, her mouth, how she's angling herself,

93
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,570
because there's so many clues into how you're doing and her body language,

94
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,810
and honestly guys, we know this about today's society,

95
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,330
there's way more truth in energy and body language and words right,

96
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,770
so pay attention to those things, um, next thing guys is, i mentioned earlier curiosity,

97
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,930
curiosity is one of the greatest things you can give

98
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,810
women because lot of psychology points to with women,

99
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,530
desire is built in gaps,

100
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:56,130
curiosity is a great gap to leave her in, um, and to show you how important this is,

101
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:02,090
if you look at the top two genres of things women watch on tv and listen to on podcast,

102
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,970
if you think about it,

103
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,770
the two most watched genres are serial killer

104
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,410
murder and um reality tv,

105
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,650
heightened drama, heightened curiosity, i don't know how this is going to end,

106
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,010
so anytime you can create what's called an open loop with her,

107
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,170
really good thing to do, and easy way to think about an open loop,

108
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:31,250
curiosity is why is netflix and shows like that so bingeable,

109
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,330
it's because they start on episode solving a problem,

110
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,290
at the very end of an episode they open a new problem,

111
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,650
they create new problem and don't give you answer, that's what an open loop is,

112
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,770
an open loop is an unanswered question a problem that has been solved,

113
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,090
the more you can do that in your conversation, the better,

114
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,930
um, one of the ways that i employ doing

115
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,890
it when i'm talking to woman is as i'm storytelling,

116
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,850
i will just like i'll drop bombshell of like maybe

117
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,370
something really hard that happened or maybe something

118
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,530
really tragic that happen to me and then i'll just move to the next subject,

119
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,170
i'll drop her something she absolutely wants to know about,

120
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,730
then i'll pretend like it's not a big deal and

121
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,290
i'll just keep talking about something else,

122
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,570
lot of times what you'll find is she'll bring you back to that,

123
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,730
hey time up, you said this, what about that?

124
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,370
um, so look for those little opportunities to create curiosity in her,

125
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,050
and guys, the last technique i want to talk to you about today is called rephrasing,

126
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,290
um, this is part of the fe protocol that if you put this in there as well,

127
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,730
just adding another layer of, i see you, hear you,

128
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,809
so as she tells you story, if she tells you story, you want to refraay,

129
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,409
so if heard that right, you did this, and then this happened,

130
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,330
and then oh my god this happened to did i hear that right like all this happened

131
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:54,730
you're basically like rephrasing her words back to her checking for clarity

132
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,250
um this is one of the best techniques you can use to not only help you understand

133
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:06,570
what she's talking about but also make her feel seen and heard too don't overuse

134
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,810
this use it anytime she goes into a monologue

135
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,410
or tells you story or tells you something you did but

136
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,970
tells you something really important,

137
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,010
rephrase it back to her just to show that you're actually paying attention,

138
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,690
you're actually listening,

139
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,890
because we know the stereotype about women complain about men's listening skills,

140
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,650
well if i just paraphrase back to you everything you said to me,

141
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,370
you can't say didn't listen to you,

142
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,810
um so guys those are five kind of second level um communication

143
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,090
techniques that i promise you if you get good at this world of talking

144
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,250
to women will change because now you have the protocol of how to structure

145
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,970
a conversation and you have the techniques of how to take those

146
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,850
conversations to the next level,

147
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,930
so guys in tomorrow's video, what we're going to go over are the steps of closing, right?

148
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,330
we're talking to woman either dating app or in person, how do we get to date?

149
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,250
so we're having this amazing conversation, how do we close?

150
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,010
all right guys, hope you got something out of the day,

151
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,970
what i want you to do guys is if you need help in your storytelling,

152
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,410
um your homework is to go right down,

153
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,170
five stories, but if you need help in your storytelling,

154
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,650
post in the group, post your story in the group and ask for feedback,

155
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,450
get other guys to help you out with it, i'll chime in there as well um to say,

156
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,930
hey say this, say not this, hey create an...

157
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,310
open loop here um and also once again use ai to help you with that,

158
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,510
but that's your homework guys is to go create those five stories, memorize them,

159
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,030
have them where you can deliver them on an amazing level to get her to feel those.

160
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,670
so all right guys, i'll see you in tomorrow's video on how to close.
