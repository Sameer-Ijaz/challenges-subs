1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,270
All right guys and welcome to day four of the

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,910
attraction blueprint and today guys we we've built the foundation,

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,110
we've got the great energy, we've got the confidence, we're in the right mindset,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,870
now let's go have an amazing conversation, and I'm going to give you two frameworks today,

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,350
I promise you they work, I have used them, my clients have used them,

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,190
hell i even use them in sales and business and they work fantastic,

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,910
so let's get into it guys, let's go ahead and jump into the framework that...

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,510
first framework i want to give you today is the i just called the fev astric

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,830
protocol and there's an astrict there for a reason i'll get into um but let's dive

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,190
into the fev framework um and here's what it is when you're talking to woman let's

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,470
just say you give her that compliment right that we talked about on day one so now

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,030
you're actually you've started the conversation you open the conversation how do

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,790
i carry on the conversation well let's do this f e v f stands for fact ask her

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,310
a fact - based question,

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,349
not a yes or no question, open - ended question, but fact - based question,

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,870
and think past the typical everyday interview style questions,

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,430
where are you from, what do you do?

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,830
think past those questions,

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,230
like oh it's like where'd you get that cup of coffee from or hey like

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,750
i'm looking for an amazing place to bring my boys to for dinner this

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,990
weekend you you know where to go um hey look um i've got some

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,950
uh empty time this week and you know a great place i can go hiking around

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,910
here ask a kind of

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,310
fun fact - based question and then she's going to give you answer all right,

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,950
so you wait for that answer, you give her plenty of space, don't interject,

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,950
let her talk, you give her plenty space to answer that question,

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,870
and then you take that fact, and now we're going to move on e stands for emotion,

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,510
what emotions does she have about that fact,

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,550
right, we know from talking to women that women are

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,550
deeply emotional creatures and they bond through emotions,

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,630
the more i can get her talking about her emotions,

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,670
the more she's going to open up to me and the more she's going to connect with me,

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,870
so i want to ask her a question like, oh wow, that hike sounds amazing,

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,950
what did you like most about it, why did you pick that hike,

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,590
why did you pick there to go on vacation,

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,150
why is that your favorite restaurant, why is that your favorite thing to cook,

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,150
why is that your favorite, why, why is such powerful question with women,

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,030
because it gets them talking emotionally to yo

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,910
u, it gets them to start connecting with you,

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,070
now find out the energy emotion behind that fact,

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,830
now v, this is the one that lot of guys have trouble with,

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,030
it's validation, so we know the fact, we know the emotion behind the fact,

43
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,150
now we want to give her some validation, and the validation is maybe a choice she made,

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,630
maybe a characteristic that she's showing, one of my favorite ones is wow,

45
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,070
like that's sounds really scary um like how brave are you or wow you like that

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,630
sounds hard you must be really smart so i'm giving her a compliment a characteristic

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,550
or um you know that decision must been really tough to make like cutos for you that

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,910
that sounds amazing so i'm complimenting something to give her validation in the

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,950
information she just told me and i'm building

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,910
her up on something that she wasn't given from birth.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,710
like lot of women, if you compliment their looks,

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,070
if you validate you know how amazing she looks or her hair or something like that,

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,550
it's not really going to hit home with her,

54
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,510
because when you compliment decision she made

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,270
or a choice or um something she did,

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,310
now what she's going to interpret that as is, wow, he actually sees me,

57
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,910
she's going to feel seen and validated when you do that, and now you're...

58
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,750
really connecting with her and boom, you just repeat the process,

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,830
fact, emotion, validate, repeat,

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,110
and feel free to go deeper on some of this stuff and ask a couple follow questions,

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,590
but that's how the conversation framework works,

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,870
because you're getting to talk getting her to talk about her emotions,

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,950
and then you're giving her validation, the two things that women love in conversation,

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,750
so here's the astric side of that, and this one to me um,

65
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,710
from my coaching practice i lot of guys struggle with,

66
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,990
so what i what i tell guys here is as you're going through this fev

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,710
protocol just to keep you from going down the rabbit hole of interview mode,

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,230
which is what a lot of guys do,

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,390
lot of mistakes a lot of guys make is rapid fire questions

70
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,230
and it just becomes this like monotone non - emotional interview,

71
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,950
never ever as you're going through this fev

72
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,910
protocol pass up michel scott that's what she said moment?

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,670
what i mean by that is never pass up a chance to inject humor into the conversation.

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,430
um, give you an example that i'll be talking with my girlfriend and she'll say something.

75
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,770
of mine um just so you get the joke uh my girlfriend's puerto rican um and she'll

76
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,370
mention something about like her favorite coffee or you know putting way too much cream

77
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,050
in her coffee i was like it's so basic white girl of you and it's just like a funny

78
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,610
thing to say at the moment it's humor she gets its humor and it's just a way to lighten

79
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,490
up the conversation look for ways like i really like she mentions just use this

80
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,490
um because lot of guys are complaining about this at the moment um you know she mentions

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,410
her love of Taylor Swift.

82
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,410
um, you could immediately say, i really thought you had better taste in music than that,

83
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,210
um, and you do it in a way where she understands it's humor, right?

84
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,010
you're you're you're injecting humor and you're picking on her,

85
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,370
you're talking to her like your bratty little sister,

86
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,290
um, you're just not crossing the line, right?

87
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,890
you're not making fun of the way she looks or her family or even like her hometown,

88
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,410
some girls get kind of sensitive about that too, so never pass up an opportunity to...

89
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,490
make a smart ass comment to inject humor into the

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,250
conversation just to keep her on an emotional roller coaster ride,

91
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,490
the more emotions, positive emotions, you can make her feel in the conversation,

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,970
the more she's going to be emotionally connected to you.

93
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,210
um, next framework i want to go over guys is the tease touch tell framework,

94
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,810
this is okay so we've gone through the FEV framework, we've got a connection going on,

95
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,410
now let me get into the flirting side of the conversation, so tease we're kind of...

96
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,490
over this um, but man,

97
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,570
like just treat her, like some of those things, some of those jokes you want to make,

98
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,890
go ahead and say them, just take the filter off, go ahead and say them, I promise you,

99
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,330
if they're done in the right energy and you've already connected,

100
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,850
it'll be okay, but tease her, she wants to be teas,

101
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,890
like she wants to, she wants that playful energy back and forth,

102
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,890
touch, right, now we're getting to physical escalation,

103
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,170
um, this is a whole separate topic that we'll talk about

104
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,090
um later if you um want to down that route with inside of the program um,

105
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,170
but you do want to start physically escalating,

106
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,170
once you've done the FV protocol and the foundation of connections there,

107
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,370
and you're teasing, you're having fun together,

108
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,970
now we'll start escalating with some small safe touches,

109
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,810
respectful touches, um, and the last one's tell, so you're teasing her,

110
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,370
you might you know touch the back of her hand or her elbow or something like that,

111
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,410
and what you want to also do if you're in a date

112
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,250
with a girl is give her these little micro tells,

113
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,410
these little micro commands.

114
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,890
um, this is beautiful thing to do because what it does,

115
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,130
it establishes your leadership, it establishes your masculine frame,

116
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,460
hey, i'm going to finish checking out, go grab that table for us,

117
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,730
or hey, i'm going to get that table, why don't you go grab us some napkins?

118
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,850
very, very small asked, but you're doing in a way is giving her a command,

119
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,570
um, you don't want to do this in a way that really comes off um in a mean,

120
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,170
condescending way, but it's like, hey, i'm doing this, why don't you do this,

121
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,410
um, but you're getting her in a very, very...

122
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,450
micro way used to following your leadership,

123
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,890
which honestly is something she wants you to do,

124
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,490
she wants you to step into a masculine leadership role, this is easy way to do that.

125
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,130
so guys, here's your homework for this week,

126
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,610
is i want you to practice the fev protocol, and inside of the group,

127
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:39,090
i want you to respond how this protocol worked, how the validation worked,

128
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,409
once you asked the fact once you got to the emotion and you validated.

129
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,490
her what happened, how did she respond to that?

130
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,530
give us some feedback guys, look, i know this protocol works,

131
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,770
um, i've never heard any negative feedback from guy that i've taught this to,

132
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,490
so i want you to go practice this, go have three conversations,

133
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,010
we practice the FED protocol and let us know how it goes,

134
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,570
so guys, next um, next video tomorrow we're going to get into advanced communication,

135
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,010
so i've given you the basic framework tomorrow,

136
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,410
we in a couple advanced techniques just to make sure that as your u

137
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,730
