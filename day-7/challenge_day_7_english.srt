00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:06,630
Hey guys and welcome to the seventh and final episode of the attraction blueprint guys,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,029
this is your bonus video,

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,710
this is the one that I probably enjoy talking

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,470
about the most and it is what makes an attractive man,

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,670
what is she truly desire and crave in a man?

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,590
And this is something that you have to do, you have to become this man,

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,590
this version of you, and it's something you have to work on,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,910
oh if you only knew how much I had to work on these things because...

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,220
'i was ofweight my entire life, was a shy introvert,

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,030
um, like i had everything against me in the world of dating,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,750
um, so the man you see before you today is giving you all this advice,

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,670
this is from working on this for a long time and getting better at this,

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,470
um, not only like my physical parents, how i dress, um, but also how i speak,

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,870
and these techniques i've learned through trial and error a lot of them,

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,390
um, these are all things that have been battle tested,

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,870
and i know for fact work not only for myself,

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,910
but dotally through my clients as well uh, i have that evidence,

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,430
so today i want to talk about what makes you desirable as a man,

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,710
very first thing guys and this is probably i put this first

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,720
because it's i don't for some reason i find the majority of guys,

21
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,270
this is the number one thing they ask me about because they

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,190
struggle with and it's humor guys you have to have a sense of humor,

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,510
you have to have that playful flirty personality,

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,750
so the biggest question a lot of guys ask me

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,310
is like robbie i'm not in like i was not naturally funny,

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,590
how do become funny?

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,070
how do i have more of a humorous personality?

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,670
here's the ways that did it for myself guys,

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,110
i actually just started watching a ton of standup

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,390
and my favorite type of stand-up is crowdwork right,

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,510
like guys like matt rife um uh i forgot his first name but um last name is car

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,510
um ferguson the late night host is fantastic at this um flirty

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,670
humor uh craig ferguson so i started studying comics of how they're talking what

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,670
what line were they using,

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,480
what was their delivery like, what was their pitch like,

36
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,470
um, what was their body link was like, i started studying that, next thing you can do um,

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,710
and actually i stole this um from

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,910
truman was write down like write down your favorite quotes,

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,750
write down your favorite stories, keep dad jokes on hand right,

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,910
like i just keep them on hand, memorize them, it's always fun to throw those out,

41
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,270
always look for opportunities in the conversation of you have a funny story about that,

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,430
tell it, you have a that's what she said comment about that,

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,660
tell it guys, there's ways you can practice humor,

44
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,310
you know get around your boys more and just like have that locker room talk with them,

45
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,590
um, yes you can memorize all of this, but you have to practice it,

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,070
you have to practice telling dad jokes, you have to practice making smart ass comments,

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,310
which is absolutely my brand of if you can't tell from our interaction so far um,

48
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,750
but you have to practice telling a funny story,

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,790
but you can't practice these things, just immerse yourself in humor, go to stand up,

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,430
i literally went to a stand-up show last week,

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,270
it was hilarious and i actually learned some stuff that i've been using,

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,150
um, but just study it guys, study it practice, you're going to get better at it.

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,590
um, next thing, you have to have an adventurous life,

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,910
you have to live adventure, you have to take risk.

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:37,470
you have to go do fun things um when i was single probably the times of

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,950
my life where i was picking up the most women having the most successful women

57
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,510
was when i was doing adventures i would go on the boat i would go you know

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,990
i'd go with a bunch of people and go um hiking or we'd go and like shoot guns

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,070
or whatever i would just go do adventurous fun things with a group of people

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,420
and women love being there right um so I would just live this like an adventurous life,

61
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,070
my buddy would call me like, hey, where are we going this weekend,

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,750
I'm like, I don't, let's find somewhere,

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,750
uh, so we go take like weekend road trips and just go live life that tells a story,

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,110
story that Shack she wants to read.

65
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,190
One of the biggest mistakes I see lot of guys making in today's dating

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,430
world is they don't live an adventurous life and they don't like those

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,910
stories that I I had you create an advanced communication lot of guys...

68
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,950
talk to don't even have those stories, okay?

69
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,670
if you don't have those stories,

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,590
you need to go make them, you need to go on some adventures,

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,190
go find some crazy fun things to do, go just go enjoy life,

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,590
those are stories you talk to women about, the more you live life,

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,590
the more interesting you are, so you have to live this adventure life guys,

74
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,990
one of the things that tell lot of my younger clients is,

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,550
hey, right now at this point in your life, say yes, until you can't say yes anymore,

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,030
stop being a hermit, stop being introvert,

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,430
stop sitting at home on the weekends, just go do stuff,

78
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,430
you may not like it, okay, whatever, you can learn from that and not do it any?

79
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,450
more, but just go do a bunch of stuff, go live an adventurous life.

80
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,730
guys, we've already talked about the third thing, confidence.

81
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,450
women deeply love confidence, why? because confidence makes a woman feel safe and secure.

82
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,010
the more confident you are,

83
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,530
the more you can be the other aspects of what she needs you to be,

84
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,010
like confidence is kind of the the foundation,

85
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,850
the root system of everything else that makes a man attractive.

86
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,410
a man's not going to go into crazy adventures if he's not company, he's not going to have.

87
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,370
humor if he's not conf cuuse he's too scared to tell the joke um so confidence is kind

88
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,650
of the foundation which all the other tractor traits come from which lead into the

89
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,930
next two the fourth thing that really makes men attractive is their

90
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:06,090
leadership now i will say this i'm not talking about bossing her around i'm not

91
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:12,410
talking about you know this this really weird leadership that lot of men think um

92
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,690
it is that like she's subservient to you blah blah blah and like no your job as a man

93
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,290
is to lead and invite her to come with you like hey i'm living this amazing life i

94
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:29,450
am going here you're more than welcome to come join me it's not hey you go no it's look

95
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,250
i'm leading you're more than welcome to follow and i'm inviting you to come with

96
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,690
me and you you actually when you're setting dates you lead her on that date you lead

97
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,410
her to the date by telling her where you're going um

98
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,970
"your job as a man is to lead right,

99
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,010
you open doors, you walk on the correct side of the sidewalk, which I know guys,

100
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,250
it's the side with the cars, not the side of the building.

101
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,610
um, I just say that I laugh about it cuz I've had so many guys ask me,

102
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,010
but you do the masculine leadership things to show her I'm in control.

103
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,650
I've even had guys asked me this like, bro, like, why,

104
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,410
like, what about you makes men want to fall?"

105
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,530
you and like how did you like why? i'm like, well

106
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,010
i know where i'm going and i know how to get there and i'm not scared to go,

107
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,570
so do it, i'm very bold and decisive in my actions, i'm very deliberate in my actions,

108
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,690
and that gives other people the the security to know they can follow me.

109
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,970
woman will never follow the leadership of a weak man that's indecisive,

110
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,410
that's constantly making mistakes.

111
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,410
that doesn't know what he wants out of life.

112
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,410
I heard one guy say like one of the best things

113
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,770
you can do as a man is you know know who you are,

114
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,650
which is confidence in leadership, know where you're going,

115
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,370
and then have a good time getting there, you can do those three three things,

116
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,730
he b like that's even more simple than what I'm talking about,

117
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,970
but like those three things make you super attractive as a man is when

118
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,250
you know who you are and you're comfortable and confident in that person,

119
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,410
you know where you're going, you're bold and decisive in your leadership.

120
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,970
and you have a good time getting there,

121
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,490
that's that, that's that humor adventure part of it.

122
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,530
um, so guys, the last component of what i want to talk about today is safety,

123
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,010
this one, especially in today's modern culture,

124
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,330
um, where we do have lot of craziness in this world, women have to feel safe with you,

125
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,450
and there's a couple different levels of safety,

126
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,970
they have to feel safe like physically, safety around, you can't be creepy,

127
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,530
you can't be awkward, you can't be weird, you can't be fidgety,

128
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,409
and all these other weird things that see a lot of guys

129
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,930
is doing because they haven't done the work on themselves,

130
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,530
so yes, a part of is physical safety,

131
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,530
a part of it is, and this is you know oftenimes misconstrued is financial safety,

132
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,050
she needs to know that is if if you two have a future together,

133
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,410
you're good right, you can take care of her, um, and when it comes to money guys,

134
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,170
like I'm tired of guys like thinking they did make a certain amount of money get the girl,

135
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,410
simply not true, I've gotten amazing women dead broad before

136
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,410
um because I had all the other characteristics of attraction.

137
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,330
but even the research points, it's not the money she's attracted to,

138
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,250
it's the characteristics of the man it took to make that

139
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,850
money that she's attracted to extroversion being one of the highest.

140
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,850
um, so she's physically safe with you,

141
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,650
she knows, you're not going to hurt her and you won't let anyone else hurt her,

142
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,690
she knows - if she wants a future with you,

143
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,650
you can financially take care of her, and the third thing,

144
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,410
the most often overlooked thing from guys is emotional safety,

145
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,850
and i often don't talk about this this early in a program guys, but i need to,

146
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,170
because i see this tripping up lot of guys,

147
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,570
so emotional safety is this: you're comfortable and okay with her emotions,

148
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,770
you know, maybe she's having a bad day, maybe she's in you know one of her hangry moods,

149
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,810
you don't let her emotions affect your emotions,

150
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,410
you are the peace in her storm, you are the rock.

151
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,090
Right, that's why that's why you often hear that cliche of mending the rock,

152
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,490
you have to be that emotional rock for her,

153
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,930
and what happens when you employ emotional safety with woman.

154
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,230
is what you'll find is she starts to depend on you more,

155
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,070
she starts to open up to you more because you're not scary,

156
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,230
she's not scared of how you're going to emotionally react,

157
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,110
this requires a high level of emotional intelligence from you,

158
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,870
you have to be in command and control of your own emotions,

159
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,750
a certain bit of stoicism um in practicing this with women,

160
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,710
but guys, i promise you when you can have and provide emotional safety,

161
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,430
emotional safety with yourself, but then provide emotional safety for her,

162
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,510
this unlocks a level of desire and attractiveness and

163
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,830
really like this feeling of her just like wanting to be close to you that few

164
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,590
guys have ever experienced,

165
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,710
because lot of women are scared to open up,

166
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,590
lot of women aresca to be emotion emotionally vulnerable and to really just

167
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,390
be like their 100% real self with men because they don't feel emotionally safe,

168
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,910
so safety is the last aspect of desire.

169
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,910
and attraction that men have to provide for women.

170
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,270
so guys, that's it,

171
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,150
those are the five biggest aspects of desire attraction i see that you

172
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,430
have to embody if you want to have real success with the women you desire,

173
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,790
the women you actually want to attract in your life,

174
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,030
because she's going to require you to have these things.

175
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,430
so guys, that's it for day seven of the attraction blueprint guys,

176
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,590
i promise you this has been a quick course um,

177
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,630
but 'if you take each of these seven days to get better at them,

178
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,030
there's yes there's next levels to this and there's deeper

179
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,270
work we can do um if you want to take that route just let us know,

180
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,880
but i promise you if you implement these seven days alone you will beat out 95%

181
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,030
of the other guys out there because they're simply just not doing these things

182
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,590
or they're just simply not good at them so get good at these seven days and

183
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,350
i promise you it will absolutely transform your dating and relationship life

184
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,910
um buse you got to remember like this is not about just tracking me this

185
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,070
keeping the woman right?

186
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,270
um, so this is something you're going to have to do from

187
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,870
the first date all the way through long-term relationship.

188
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,230
