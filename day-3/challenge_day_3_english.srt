00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,390
All right guys, welcome to day three of the Attraction Blueprint.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,750
I'm your coach Robbie Dangelo and today we're going to talk about energy priming.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,710
Um, guys, when you're dealing with women and, even on the phone or text messaging,

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,870
energy priming is absolutely powerful, because I joke all the time,

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,670
the greatest gift women were ever were given is their gift of intuition.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,910
Women are incredibly intuitive creatures and what I mean by that is...

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,830
they just feel energy a different level than men do,

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,470
they feel that they're safe and secure, they feel their surroundings,

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,190
they feel other people.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,470
um, i actually bring my girlfriend with me to networking

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,750
events because how good her energy radar is with other people,

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,630
and it's actually scientifically measurable thing that we're not going to get into today,

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,870
but i just want to make you aware of that so you understand

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,550
that your energy is going to dictate how she responds to you.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,910
lot of guys, they just try to...

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,750
learn the next trick, the next you know line to say,

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,790
and I've worked with so many guys and they are saying all the right things,

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,190
but their energy doesn't match that,

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,070
and the problem with that is when your words are great and your energy sucks,

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,070
what that's going to signal to her is,

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,550
hold on, something's out of alignment, I don't feel safe here, I don't feel safer,

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,910
he's given me the ick or he's unattractive and I don't know why, you have to be...

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,070
alignment so today we're going to talk about energy priming and the very first

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,230
tool i want to give you today is something learned in my peak performance

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,190
coaching um when i was working with a group of operators special forces guys that

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,470
i promise you if you ever have struggled with nerves around women this

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,510
is extremely powerful i still do this if i'm in a tough conversation or somebody

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,910
says something that bothers me i will immediately go into this just to bring

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,430
my central nervous system back down to homeostasis so i can perform at an you know

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,229
emotionally level playing field,

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,310
so the first thing i want to go with you today guys, it's navy seal box breeding,

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,750
it was actually developed for the navy seals when they're going into combat,

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,830
they don't need to be in a heightened emotional state, they need to be in a nice calm,

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,510
logical thinking state so they can operate in their mission without making mistakes,

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,070
so where this comes into play for you is maybe before you talk to her,

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,870
maybe before you get a phone call with her or facetime,

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,190
or especially before you go a date with woman,

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,030
this will put you in a nice calm

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,230
energy that really transfers to her as being safe and secure,

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,390
so box breathing is this,

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,310
if you literally just picture box in your mind and either

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,910
draw a number four for most people um four sides of the box,

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,510
the number four on each side of the box, you breathe in four seconds,

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:05,870
hold four seconds, breathe out four seconds, hold four seconds, super easy, box breathing,

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,790
just every side of the box has four, easy way to remember, picture it in your brain,

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,070
you breathe through that four, five times and you will literally feel your body calm down,

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,470
so this is going to give you that great calm energy,

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,870
the reason this energy um techniques work so well is every time you

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,630
hold your breath you're basically signaling to your body i'm in control,

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,790
i got this, you can calm down,

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,550
now so that's something absolutely once you start practicing today,

52
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,990
like literally as soon as you get down watching this video,

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,750
go into box breathing and just feel that calm your body down and then

54
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,030
start doing it anytime before you have an interaction with a female or really

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,110
anytime that you're feeling anxious or you feel like that energy level just getting

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,510
a little heavy on you.

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,830
next thing i want to do guys is i want you to start practicing the one-up principle,

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,150
here's what i mean by this and i still practice today,

59
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,790
even though i am in a great relationship with my girlfriend,

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,550
is i want you to start dressing one level above anywhere you go,

61
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,510
i don't care if it's to the gym, i don't care if it's to the office a date,

62
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,320
like if you're going a date somewhere,

63
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,910
you know check the place out ahead of time, you're supposed to do that,

64
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,310
um, that's part of like you know reconnaissance work uh,

65
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,110
but check out where you're going and then just kind of dress one level

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,870
of don't go overboard like i'm not asking you to go grab sushi in a tucks,

67
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,270
what i am saying is, hey, actually dress,

68
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,510
just start dressing one level above everyone around you, just one little increment, why?

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,630
it's going to make you feel good,

70
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,190
you taking care of yourself and wearing some

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,950
nice pressed clothes from the dry cleaner or even like taking clothes to the tailor,

72
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,710
getting them fitted, please do that, it makes such huge difference,

73
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,910
but when you start dressing one level above anywhere,

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,750
you're going and guys to crack a joke about this,

75
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,710
i used to practice this right, i still do actually,

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,670
like me and my girlfriend go somewhere,

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,790
we're always dress and i've got her doing it too,

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,150
we're always dressed like one level higher than where we're going,

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,650
but my boys you saw exactly bro what's up with you like we're just going

80
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,170
to go grab bite we're going to grab beer like why are you why hey i literally

81
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,210
could meet my wife tonight like i don't know i'm going to be prepared um but

82
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,050
it would just make me feel good right and think about that when um deon sanders

83
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,410
used to always say like um look good play good and it's same thing happens

84
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,290
in dating guys you look good you're going to play better because you feel better

85
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,730
um and last thing that i want to go with you guys so those are two like really cool

86
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,810
energy priming things um there's some other things you can do too like you know

87
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,610
listen to some music to get you in the right mood some of my guys that struggle

88
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,450
with humor actually um i get them to watch comedy specials before they go a date

89
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,130
um i used to listen to uh comedy in my car on the way to the day just to put me

90
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,690
in a playful fun mood um so there's things like that you can do for energy priming

91
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,730
um which we absolutely can go over later but the last thing i want to go over

92
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,410
today guys is actually your exercise your homework

93
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,970
um, one of the things that I used to practice all the time is called the doorway exercise.

94
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,930
This is absolutely something that will transform how you into a room,

95
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,050
how you take presence and get noticed when you walk in somewhere,

96
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,330
is I want you to start practicing your house, every doorway that you walk through,

97
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,930
stop, breathe, stand up tall,

98
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,410
smile, walk through, start practice, look, it's going to feel goofy as...

99
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,690
practicing this in your apartment in your condo in your house,

100
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,210
but what is going to train you to subcciously when you enter room,

101
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,050
your chin, your chin's up, chest is up, you're walking taller, you're smiling,

102
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,450
you just have a bigger bolder presence about you,

103
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,930
that way when she sees you for the first time, boom, you know your posture is on check,

104
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,050
you know your energy is good, and even like just doing that guys,

105
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,930
there's some actual studies about like power

106
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,410
posing and increasing your testosterone, which is a...

107
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,330
thing um so there is some science behind this too,

108
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,210
but I want you to start practicing the doorway exercise,

109
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,210
it's going to feel goofy as hell by yourself in your apartment, in your condo, whatever,

110
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,970
but as you get out in the real world you start doing this to people start noticing,

111
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,770
i um long story but i adopted kid for a little while um and had him live with

112
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,210
me just kind of get him off the streets and he used to always ask me like why

113
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,970
do people look at you when you walk in the room like people don't look at me like

114
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,250
that why do they look at you i was like it's the energy and the presence that

115
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,410
I bring into room.

116
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,930
I bring a very confident, bold energy into the room.

117
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,250
I don't come into a room ducking, looking, hiding around, right?

118
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,690
I come in there big and bold because I own the room.

119
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,570
Why? Because I've done the energy work ahead of time before I walk in.

120
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,130
Uh, so that's i once you start practicing the

121
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,850
door exercise to get yourself into a better energy,

122
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,890
but also remember the navy seal box breathing and the one-up man principle,

123
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,410
um, just dressing better than anyone around you. Guys, but...

124
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,530
'if you do these three things consistently,

125
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,290
it's going to put you in a much better energy that women can actually feel,

126
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,010
because I promise you when I took talk to women,

127
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,210
it's one of the biggest things that women complain about is like I don't,

128
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,890
he just he just didn't have it, he just didn't feel confident,

129
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,049
feel, women use the word feel a lot because that's all they're concerned about right,

130
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,010
so you have to have the energy that transfers to them,

131
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,809
all right guys, that's what I've got for today as far as energy priming,

132
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,530
there's so many.' level so this is what i would love to talk to you about

133
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,210
in the future um but that's just kind of a real short video on that now tomorrow

134
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,690
day four we actually get into my conversation framework so now you're confident

135
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,810

136
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,320
