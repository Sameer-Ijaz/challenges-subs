1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,630
All right guys and welcome to day two of the Attraction Blueprint

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,029
and we're going to add another level to confidence today and

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,150
we're going to talk about having a growth mindset and active reframing.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,270
The reason these two things are so important is guys hate to break it to you,

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,310
but you live in the real world with real objections, real rejections and real people.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,230
Nothing's linear and lot of mistakes that guys make is they think there's

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,910
like this just five-step plan of success and I'm sorry that's just not how...

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,270
this works, so what I want to give you today is a couple tools

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,460
to help you just build upon your confidence in a more active way,

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,830
in a more like internal way where you can,

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,030
tell better stories and reframe things that happen to you,

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,230
so you're becoming stronger through this process,

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,670
you're becoming better through this process and not letting things drag you down,

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,150
not letting things beat you up,

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,910
so the first thing I want to talk about is the power of story,

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,670
when we are out in the real world, we're talking to women when we're having conversations,

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,710
we're interacting with anyone, we're constantly creating internal stories,

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,510
and the cool thing about that is you are the creator of those stories,

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,350
so the question to then ask yourself is how

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,630
much power do I have in the creation of that story,

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,430
am I letting the world tell me my story,

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,190
am I letting my failures create story, am I letting my rejections create that story,

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,870
or am I tak this upon myself and saying no,

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,030
I'm the creator, I actually create these stories and I'm going to write a better story.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,430
Yeah, I might have failed in the past.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,830
Yeah, I might have had some problems, but you know what,

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,070
I don't have to be that person, the past is the past.

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,270
It's called that for a reason i can now today decide to make and create better story,

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,790
so you have that free will, and I love um,

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,910
great book by Victor Frankel, um, man search for meaning talks about the real power.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,350
have is in the separation between stimulus and response,

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,389
that space there between stimulus and how you respond to that stimulus,

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,950
that is actually your free will and that is your space to create story.

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,230
this is super powerful, especially when deal with women,

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,150
because let's be honest, they will be the biggest trigger in your life,

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,230
so the more space you can create there between stimulus and response,

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,910
the more power you then have to write a better story, so lot of...

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,070
when they hear this though, they're going to think affirmations and positive self talk,

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,590
look, all that is powerful for the right person,

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,390
it is called personal development for a reason, it's highly personal,

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,550
but what i like to do is say, okay, who do i want to be, what story i want to write,

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,960
but more importantly, and this is part of this whole equation,

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:55,110
is what identity do i want to create for myself,

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,790
and it's not about faking it to you make it,

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,910
it's literally about who do i want to be in this world, okay?

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,550
in order to be that person, must take on that identity,

47
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,750
because without getting like too deep in the rabbit hole guys,

48
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,790
who you are as an identity dictates the actions you take, right?

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,990
like if you are the identity of,

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,510
hey, i have amazing conversation skills and i'm absolutely great with women,

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,750
you're going to take actions from that identity,

52
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,150
so when i think about like positive self-talk affirmations,

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,910
i'm to me thinking about creating a stronger identity,

54
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,310
this for myself and it's going to sound cheesy but it is what it is like before

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,110
i would go a date and before i would go talk to him like man she's so lucky that i'm

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,550
going to go talk to her right now because i'm an absolute gift right i'm i'm the man

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,110
she desires to be with so the fact i'm going to talk to her she's incredibly lucky

58
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,230
right now that's the identity that i would take on before i would go talk to her

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,710
cause it would put me a state of abundance it would put me a really powerful

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,590
um mindset so that's kind of what i want to talk to you about today is like what

61
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,910
identity do you want to have?

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,150
that goes and talks to women and putting yourself in that identity right,

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,030
like just talking yourself like, hey, i am this person,

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,310
i'm not the kind of person that thinks this way, no, i am this person.

65
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,990
um, step two today guys is active reframing through my health journey,

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,390
through my coaching practice, this is probably the you know most powerful,

67
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,990
most powerful thing that ever learned how to do,

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,790
um, and even with my clients, i like i said, i coach lot of high performance clients too,

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,550
active reframing is one of the most powerful

70
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,790
things you learn how to do in this world of growth,

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,710
so here's what it is, active reframing is something happens,

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,790
how do i want to reframe what just happened right?

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,870
this really easy example of that is let's say a girl turns down,

74
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,550
she rejects you, okay, you could one frame could be,

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,510
oh man, i'm a loser, she rejected me, i'm not good enough, or you could reframe that like,

76
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,910
okay, cool, i guess i'm just not her type, how can i get better?

77
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,510
okay, she obviously like didn't like something i said, maybe we should vibe,

78
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,030
maybe you know we're just on two different planes, whatever,

79
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,270
how could i get better from this, like what can i say differently,

80
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,430
what can do differently next time, it's not me person

81
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,530
personally is just maybe something just what in alignment right?

82
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,850
i'm going to look at the things that happen in my life that stimulus creates space

83
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,570
between response and in that space i'm going to reframe that in a way that's going

84
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,570
to make me a better person do and believe what makes you better so i'm going

85
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,330
to reframe what just happened in a positive way and say okay what you're right

86
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,890
didn't say this right i should have said this i should ask this question maybe

87
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,410
i shouldn't have talked so much.

88
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,610
Maybe I should have been more in a state of curiosity,

89
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,810
um, so I'm going to actively reframe that

90
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,450
situation to put myself in a better position moving forward,

91
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,130
so that is what I want you to practice this week,

92
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,050
in your interactions with people, as you're out there playing the compliment game,

93
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,890
before you go and give the compliment, I want you to actively put in a new identity,

94
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,090
all right, so what identity do I want to have,

95
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,410
who do I want to be, how do I want to show up before?

96
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,170
you will give that compliment and then if something negative happens,

97
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,850
you actively reframe it in that moment,

98
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,090
not later when you're journaling, that's what's called active reframing,

99
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,570
you're going to reframe it in that moment and say,

100
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,540
oh you know what, it's cool, like I learned this,

101
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,570
um, next, I you should teach lot of sales,

102
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,770
and when I was teaching sales, I would tell guys,

103
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,930
no just means next, right, yes, you want to get better from no,

104
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,690
but let's actively reframe no to next,

105
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,570
right, okay, so I got rejection, how do I take that, get better from it,

106
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,890
all right, moving on, that does that no longer bothers me,

107
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,570
it was a is a great learning lesson.

108
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,410
okay, so that's the challenge I want to give you for today is active reframing,

109
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,890
when that self-doubt appears, when that insecurity appears,

110
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,050
when you have any type of negative thought come into your brain,

111
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,250
reframe it and then take action.

112
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,130
action from day one I told you, action is the most important thing right,

113
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,050
because nothing happens without action,

114
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,410
so how can I create new identity actively reframe to?

115
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,130
keep myself in a positive momentum, keep myself positively moving forward,

116
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,970
that's it for today guys, hope you got something out of it, leave us some comments,

117
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,330
let us know how this new identity and this active reframing is working for you guys,

118
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,770
we love hearing your feedback in the community and for day three tomorrow we're

119
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,330
going to talk about energy priming because lik

120
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,890
e we talked about yesterday she feels energy,

121
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,730
energy is the most important thing that you can possibly transfer to her,

122
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,290
so tomorrow we're going to get into energy priming,

123
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,450
i just need you in the right mindset before we could do a little bit energy work,

124
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,490
so guys, hope you got something out of it,

125
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,570
thank you so much for tuning in and I'll see you tomorrow.
