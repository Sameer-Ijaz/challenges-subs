00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,830
Hey guys and welcome to day six of the attraction blueprint,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,990
so you've done all the hard work right, we've got the confidence, got the mindset,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,510
we know how to talk to a girl, we've built an amazing connection through conversation,

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,030
she's feeling the energy still in the vibe, um

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,550
, by the way, I love how women use that word,

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,030
um, vibe check, uh, that's like their catchphrase right now,

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,390
why she get good vibes from him, well, it's your job as the man to give her those vibes,

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,910
um, that's why the energy transfer so...

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,390
important so today we're going to talk about the clothes and what i'm going to do

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,190
is i'm going to give you few of my favorite closing techniques um because what

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,910
happens is and this is so funny um i actually did a bunch of street interviews with

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,190
women a while back and it's one of the like biggest complaints about women is

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,670
he didn't ask me out like we just kept talking and i put him in the friend zone

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,390
because he wouldn't lead and on especially on dating apps um women want to as soon

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,590
as they feel a connection to lead and close and i literally heard one girl say it's

16
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,990
called a dating app,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,590
it's not a friendship app, ask me out,

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,470
It's so funny when i heard her say that like ah man

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,150
that's so true and it's a big mistake lot of guys make,

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,070
you're scared to close because you're scared of rejection,

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,830
but we are talked about active reframing and how

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,470
to get around that so i'm not really worried about that,

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,390
but let's talk about how to increase your success rate with closing,

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,870
first thing i want to talk about is on the dating apps

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,830
themselves - because I think this is where most of you guys are at,

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,470
your dating apps, let's talk about how we close uh,

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,190
so when it comes to closing a dating app, your job through conversation,

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,830
and look, you're using that fev protocol with humor,

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,030
with storytelling, using all those things to build

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,030
emotional investment through text messaging a dating app,

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,430
and by the way, secret weapon, if you have the ability use a voice note,

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,110
voice notes are absolutely killer on dating apps,

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,550
um, but as having that conversation with her a dating app,

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,190
your job is to bring her in emotionally,

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,310
to build her emotional investment into going out with you,

36
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,710
you get her to the point where she has to meet you, she has to see you in person,

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,150
and you use all the advanced communication, the frameworks to get her to that point,

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,030
so what you're looking for is you're looking for signs of investment,

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,910
this can be long replies, um, this can be her asking you amazing questions,

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,270
um, lot of emojis, uh, really, it's basically reciprocated effort,

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,670
is she giving you as much effort in the conversation as you're giving her,

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,050
and once you notice that investment's high and

43
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,430
once you notice she's into the conversation,

44
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,390
the rule that kind of use here guys, um, and it's it's cliche, but it absolutely is true,

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,870
is strike while they aren't hot, lot of guys, i see this time and time again,

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,310
lot of guys make the mistake of waiting until the conversation dies down,

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,510
oh crap, i don't have anything else to say, let me ask her out,

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,230
no, you get her to an emotional crescendo and then you capitalize on that emotion,

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,590
how you that emotion to date?

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,990
oh my god, this is so amazing, we've got to see if this is real in person,

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,550
like this has been an amazing conversation,

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,430
i can't wait to see how good this is actually going to be with the real you,

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,350
so you're getting her to that emotional peak,

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,030
she's into you, she's getting the vibes as she says,

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,870
um, and then you're taking advantage of that emotional high,

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,110
that's when you move into the close, and here is my absolute favorite close,

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,950
um, it works a ton and i haven't had lot

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,550
of negative feedback when guys have use this close,

59
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,950
because it gets a micro commitment, it's true and it just works,

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,030
so get to that emotional high point, first thing you say is,

61
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,670
i don't about you, but i absolutely hate these dating apps,

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,030
um, whatever your opinion of them is chances are she's going to say something

63
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,750
of micro compliance of oh my god me too or you have no idea or she'll give you

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,550
something that agrees with your statement so you have no idea how much hate these

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,510
dating apps i much prefer the real world or some variation of or something about

66
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,550
like hate the online world i like the real world better um but when she says

67
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,030
something that agrees with that statement what she's done is she's ' given you micro

68
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,510
compliance of the real world,

69
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,110
so you give her that, I don't about you, but I hate dating apps,

70
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,150
I much prefer the real world, yes, me too, great, why don't we,

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,230
and then you suggest the date, never ever ever ask these two questions in person,

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,350
a dating app, in a relationship, in marriage,

73
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,470
never, never, as long as you're dating women,

74
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,910
ask these two questions, when you're free, what do you want to do,

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,910
that is kryptonite in the dating world, why?

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,950
shows zero effort, zero leadership,

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,150
zero confidence, i say suggest the date,

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,430
and what i mean by that is, why don't we go do this at this?

79
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,490
on this date, or i bet we would have so much fun doing this,

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,770
this time of this date, oh my god, you're going to have so much fun when we go do this,

81
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:27,050
this time or this date, you're telling her what you want to go do, when and where,

82
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,170
when you do that, you're going to get three possible answers from that suggestion,

83
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,250
first possible answer, best case scenario is sounds great,

84
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,410
let's do it, second possible answer you're going to get from that is:

85
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,530
probably scheduling conflict right, you just gave her very specific time in a date,

86
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,330
we live in a very busy world, she may have something going on, and by the way,

87
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,890
to increase your odd success, always set the first date Monday through Thursday,

88
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,010
women are typically bit busier, already have plans, Friday, Saturday, Sunday,

89
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,890
so just to increase your odds of her being free,

90
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,730
Monday through Thursday is typically better first date um time slot,

91
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,970
so those are the first two answers you're

92
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,410
going to get from um that close if you do it right,

93
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,610
third uh,

94
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,010
it's really funny, the third thing women will do when you suggest date

95
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,930
is they will literally ignore that you just said that and keep talking to you,

96
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,290
it's it's like they don't know what, it's like

97
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,650
they think we don't know what just happened,

98
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,530
but it actually frustrates lot of guys,

99
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,530
but you've got confidence, you know how to reframe this,

100
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,410
and the reframe there is just not yet, she's not ready to go a date with me yet,

101
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,210
so i'm going to go back to building in emotional investment,

102
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,770
i'm going to go back to the fev protocol

103
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,450
and i'm going to wait until i get another emotional investment crescendo,

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,810
another emotional investment buy in, and then i'm going to try again,

105
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,370
and when i try again, i'm probably one of those three answers again,

106
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,410
if it happens a second time, feel free to call it out,

107
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:12,410
something as simple as you know what you just did, or i know you saw that, or hey

108
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,930
we ain't here to play games,

109
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,890
call her out on ignoring that message she obviously read and just have fun with it.

110
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,570
um, this is part of that flirty interaction, some women do play hard to get,

111
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,850
some women do like for some reason make you really earn a date with them,

112
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,730
especially if they're getting lot of attention,

113
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,330
which if you're going after an attractive woman,

114
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,690
hey to break it to you, she's getting lot of attention,

115
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,410
um, so you might have to go through this like emotional investment,

116
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:50,130
ask out, emotional investment, ask out, emotional investment, call her out.

117
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,770
um, so you might have to go through that iteration a couple times, but i promise you,

118
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,530
that framework absolutely works if you did the job of the conversation,

119
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,170
building the emotional investment on the front in,

120
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,730
and guys, like when you're doing this in person, almost a same happens,

121
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,850
the only thing tell guys to do in person

122
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,410
is before you start the conversation with her, give

123
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,050
her a like pre-framed time exit of hey,

124
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,290
you was just on my way to the gym, i got a couple minutes, i just want to tell you,

125
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,250
give her the compliment or give her your opening line or just like pre-frame that of hey,

126
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,250
i was just on the way to a meeting, but had to come say hello to you,

127
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,690
um, i've only got a couple minutes - going to meet somebody,

128
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,330
but brief frame that like time constraint,

129
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,890
because what that does for her is it takes the

130
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,409
pressure off for her of thinking that you're going to be there.

131
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,450
her for an hour um that is actually fear a lot of girls have is oh my god i don't want

132
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,170
to talk i'm going somewhere i don't want to be late um so if you pre-frame this exit

133
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,690
um it really helps her just like kind of um take her guard down to know that you're not

134
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,050
going to sit and talk to her for 30 minutes um also watch your body language like kind

135
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,250
of keep an open body language sir so you're not like threatening um keep your distance

136
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,570
a little bit keep an open body language and as you're in the conversation you can square

137
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:17,290
up with her um as she opens and welcomes to that in that in-person interaction

138
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,570
um and then as you're going to the close there you're going to once again transition

139
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,130
um and what i like to do is i like to bring up the like high point of the conversation

140
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,170
so if she like got really excited talking about let's just say her trip to japan as i'm

141
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,210
going to close um i would like japan i really want to know more about that let's connect

142
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,410
and go grab a drink or it talks about

143
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,010
Maybe her favorite type of food,

144
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,530
oh my god, I can't wait to take you to this place to go get that, let's connect and go,

145
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,770
and couple of things you can do there, I like getting a phone number closed,

146
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:01,930
um, but lot of guys uh still intimidated to do that, so easiest way to do it is um,

147
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,090
you literally can go through the communication

148
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,930
techniques and protocols and hey let's connect on instagram,

149
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,410
very non-invasive, very non-threatening, hey, why don't we?

150
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,350
man of intention, be intentional, lead the conversation, lead to the close,

151
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,070
and then get out of there and then leave her a high note,

152
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,230
crack a joke about something you just said,

153
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,510
like i still can't believe you said japan was your favorite vacation ever,

154
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,830
um, as you're like walking out there,

155
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,430
or it still trips me out that really your favorite food group is a salad,

156
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,710
i just don't understand that, and then walk away, leave her on some type of joke,

157
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,870
some type of high note as you're exiting that conversation,

158
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,910
just so her last memory of you is...
